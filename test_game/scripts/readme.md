# notes

there are two versions of the trim script. They take text from a walkthrough and remove all the sentences that already have a period. This ends up being all the descriptive lines. What's left is lines that were entered on the ">" prompt. This is all the vocabulary from the game as it is to be used by a player. Then, for the parser, the script puts a period after the sentences.

One version also adds a keyword to the end of the sentences. This is so that they are labled somehow for the w2v program. This second version of the script is probably not needed for most people.
